{"info":{"title":"Inbox API","version":"1.0.0","description":"\nThe Inbox API gives you full access to manage the following entities in your team:\n- **Threads**: DM conversations on X\n- **Account links**: X accounts connected to your team\n- **Members**: users who can access the team\n- **Prospects**: external profiles on X\n- **Tags**: labels for prospects\n- **Statuses**: pipeline statuses for prospects\n\nAs of now, access to the following is not available:\n- **Lists**: Saved collections of leads\n- **Campaigns**: Automated DM sequences\n\n## A quick note on IDs\nInbox stores two types of IDs for objects that relate to X:\n- `id` — The Inbox ID, which is the ID of the Inbox object\n- `platformId` — The original X 'platform' ID, which is the ID of the X user, conversation, etc.\n\nThroughout the API, you'll see instances where multiple IDs are present. `platformId` is always the original X ID.\n\n## Helpful X URLs\n\nYou can use platform IDs to construct direct links to X:\n\n- **User profile**: `https://x.com/i/user/{platformId}` — This is the most reliable way to link to a user since it uses their immutable ID rather than their username, which can change.\n- **User by username**: `https://x.com/{username}` — Note that usernames can change, so this link may break if the user updates their handle.\n- **Tweet/Post**: `https://x.com/anyusername/status/{tweetId}` — The username in the URL is ignored by X; only the tweet ID matters. You can use any string in place of the username and the link will still work.\n- **DM conversation**: `https://x.com/i/chat/{conversationPlatformId}` — The conversation ID is formatted as `{smallerUserId}:{largerUserId}`, where the two participant user IDs are sorted numerically (smaller ID first).\n\n## Encoding objects and arrays in query params\n\nInbox's API uses bracket notation to denote objects and arrays.\n\n### Objects\nFor an endpoint that accepts a `cursor` parameter for instance, with the cursor object being\n```json\n{\n  id: \"l44e15irdq4db30i77cgphhx\",\n  timestamp: \"2025-11-10T18:03:16.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\nThe URL search params would be encoded as:\n```txt\n?cursor[id]=l44e15irdq4db30i77cgphhx&cursor[timestamp]=2025-11-10T18:03:16.000Z\n```\n\n### Arrays\nFor an endpoint that accepts an `ids` parameter for instance, with the value being\n```json\n[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\n```\n\nthere are three options:\n1. Repeat the parameter for each value:\n```txt\n?ids=1&ids=2&ids=3\n```\n2. Append `[]` to explicitly denote an array (useful if there's only one value):\n```txt\n?ids[]=1&ids[]=2&ids[]=3\n```\n3. Append `[number]` to denote the array index. This option is the most flexible and allows for reordering and skipping values:\n```txt\n?ids[0]=1&ids[1]=2&ids[2]=3\n```\n\n","summary":"The Inbox API gives you full access to manage the following entities in your team."},"servers":[{"url":"https://inboxapp.com/api/v1"}],"tags":[{"name":"Teams","description":"Teams are shared workspace for members to view and manage account links, tags, statuses, campaigns, conversations, and more."},{"name":"Threads","description":"\nThreads represent conversations between an account linked to your team and a prospect on Twitter.\n            "},{"name":"Messages","description":"\nMessages are the individual messages sent in a thread.\n            "},{"name":"Account Links","description":"\nAccount links represent X accounts connected to your team.\n            "},{"name":"Members","description":"\nMembers are Inbox users who can access the team.\n            "},{"name":"Prospects","description":"\nProspects represent external profiles on X.\n            "},{"name":"Tags","description":"\nTags are labels for prospects.\n            "},{"name":"Statuses","description":"\nStatuses are used to track the deal stage or any fixed state for a prospect.\n            "},{"name":"Colors","description":"\nGet predefined color options that can be used when creating or updating tags and statuses.\n            "}],"components":{"securitySchemes":{"bearerAuth":{"type":"http","scheme":"bearer"}},"schemas":{"Prospect":{"type":"object","properties":{"platform":{"enum":["twitter"],"description":"The social platform where this prospect's profile exists.","examples":["twitter"]},"platformId":{"type":"string","description":"The platform's native user ID.
